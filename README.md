# Aeolus

In Greek mythology, **Aeolus** is the keeper of the winds - he holds them in a cave and releases or restrains them at will.

*Clouds don't move themselves.*

Aeolus is a TUI dashboard for managing [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code), [Codex CLI](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/codex/cli), and [Gemini CLI](https://geminicli.com/docs/get-started/installation/) sessions running across tmux panes. It shows provider identity and live output, and lets you approve or deny Claude permission requests without switching panes.

## Features

- Lists tmux panes running Claude Code, Codex CLI, or Gemini CLI (other panes are hidden)
- Shows Claude session status: idle, working, waiting for permission, or waiting for an answer
- Approve / deny Claude requests with a single keypress
- Shows Codex and Gemini activity as unknown; use `enter` to inspect and respond in the pane
- Auto-refreshes every 2 seconds
- Colored pane preview with live terminal output

## Usage

```
make build   # build ./aeolus binary
make run     # go run .
```

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `j` / `↓` | Next session |
| `k` / `↑` | Previous session |
| `enter` | Switch tmux client to selected pane |
| `y` | Approve Claude permission request / answer yes |
| `a` | Approve Claude permission request for the session |
| `n` | Deny Claude permission request / answer no |
| `x` | Kill selected pane after confirmation |
| `r` | Force refresh |
| `q` | Quit |

## Requirements

- tmux
- go v1.26.4 or higher
- One or more `claude`, `codex`, or `gemini` sessions running inside tmux panes

## Provider detection

Detection uses executable names and known npm entry points in the pane process tree. It does not treat agent names in prompts, command arguments, or captured output as evidence of an agent. Custom wrapper names and process paths containing spaces may not be detected; use a standard CLI entry point. Codex and Gemini do not inherit Claude output parsing or approval keys. A detected agent with unreadable output remains listed with unknown activity.
